### Description

This Quiz-Board project is about making the interface logic and business logic where the interface logic is a form made by different questions with relative answers in the radio buttons form. The user has to choose one answer while clicking on the corresponding button. At the end there is a submit button where while you submit the score will be shown. 
 I used HTML ,CSS, javascript and Markdown languages.
